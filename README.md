# Problem Statement
The Indian Premier League (IPL) has emerged as a significant engine of economic growth, driving sectors like advertising, broadcasting, e-commerce, and tourism 💼📈. However, its increasing reliance on sponsorships and advertisements from fantasy sports apps 🎮 and pan masala brands 🚬 has raised ethical concerns.
With over half of IPL's ads tied to these industries, there is growing debate around the league’s role in endorsing potentially harmful products and behaviors ⚠️. This highlights the importance of examining not just the IPL’s commercial achievements, but also the broader ethical and social impact of its advertising strategies 🧠.
